Class Participation
-------------------

Attendance in all classes is a base-line pre-requisite for this part of the grade - consistent attendance earns a grade of "90". This can be reduced with absences and increased by making informed contributions to class discussions, particularly comments that incorporate insights from reading assignments. There is no reward for maximizing "air time" - in fact we highly value efforts at encouraging contributions by others and shared learning by the entire class.

Also, a special web site has been established for you to document key lessons learned each week. While specific content will not be graded, participation in this system is expected as part of class participation.
